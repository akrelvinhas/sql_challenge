Employee Data Exploration Project

Within the scope of the employee data exploration project, I delved into the historical employment records of a company throughout the 1980s and 1990s. This involved the meticulous examination of six CSV files containing comprehensive employee data.

Key Project Features:

1. Data Modeling: Formulating the design of database tables tailored to accommodate the intricacies of the CSV data.

2. Data Engineering: Executing the importation of CSV data into a SQL database, facilitating seamless accessibility and manipulation.

3. Data Analysis: Crafting SQL queries to address pivotal questions, extracting valuable insights from the dataset.

Project Organization:

- ER Diagram: Discover both an ERD image and a text file within the dedicated ER Diagram folder.

- EmployeeSQL_tables.sql: Initiate the creation of tables by executing this script, implementing the designed schemata.

- EmployeeSQL_queries.sql: Employ this script to execute queries, thereby extracting meaningful information from the dataset.

- Data: The repository for historical employee data is housed within the Data folder.

References: The dataset utilized in this project was generated by Mockaroo, LLC (2022), a provider of realistic data through its "Realistic Data Generator."
